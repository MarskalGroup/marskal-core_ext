# Marskal::CoreExt

This gem contains several extensions to the core classes of Ruby. 
This was developed using Ruby 2.0 and Ruby 2.1 but many of the extension will likely work with other versions.

```ruby
gem 'marskal-core_ext'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install marskal-core_ext

## Usage

* Array 
* Date
* File

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
